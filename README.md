# Balance_Function_Jet
This code is for analysing data(p-p) inside the jet using the Balance Function Method. The data are from CERN CMS' run of 2016,2017, 2018.
The set up is usually implemented in CERN's computing platform(LXPLUS). Root Framework is used to analyse the data.
Below is the brief description of the codes.
1) Tree_Analyzer_NewNew_Condor.C-> It helps to process  and  filter  the data and and stored in a 3d Vector(event->jet->tracks).
2) read_tree_New_CMSpythia.h-> This header file is used to retreive the data from a tree(a data structure in Root framework).
